First my name is Carlos Daniel GUtierrez and I am 17 years old, I am from the manglar clan and now I am going to explain my repository.

-We have a web website called “portfolio” which is simple to use to consult my basic personal information and on the other hand we have a sign in type of website where people give their information to me.

Starting with the first page what I did was to divide it into sections vertically adding a hyperlinked navigation bar so I don't need to scroll.
It is divided into “About me”, “Skills” and “Contact me” in these sections I have all relevant information about me.

The other page is only a sign in type of website where I get information from other people.

For this project we used Html and css
- Applying css grid and flexbox to make the page more presentable.
- Also a responsive model was applied to both pages to adapt properly to different types of screens without the objects contained within these were not similar.
